# Orebody — development tracking

Living backlog of what the product needs next. Each item is also a GitHub issue
in `shayne-wq/orebody`; this file is the at-a-glance index. Check items off here

## Context driving this backlog

Two facts reshape the roadmap:

1. **Most projects are pure exploration.** They have drilling, geophysics and
   geochem but **no block model and no economics** — a resource (and therefore
   tonnage/grade/ounces) comes much later. The console today *requires* a block
   model per zone, which locks these projects out. Making the block model
   optional is the highest-priority change.
2. **Magnetics is the backbone of exploration data.** The current geophysics
   slot only stores an uploaded image. Real magnetic grids — georeferenced,
   typed (TMI/RTP/1VD…), with a legend — need first-class support.

Already shipped: projects hold **multiple zones**, each with its own block
model, drills, surfaces, property and geophysics; a deck records the zones it
spans. The **authoring/upload path is done**; the viewer still renders a single
deposit (#3).

The tracking branch is now **merged into `main`** — it had diverged from a
night of viewer work (WebGL fallback, boot diagnostics, externalised block
model), and two sources of truth is one too many.

## P0 — exploration blockers

- [x] 🟢 **#1 — Support pure-exploration projects: make the block model optional.**
  <https://github.com/shayne-wq/orebody/issues/1>
  **Viewer done.** A deck with no `blocks` dataset no longer throws; it enters
  exploration mode. `N=0` is the mechanism — every model-driven loop walks
  `RUNS` or counts to `N`, so an empty model no-ops the render path without a
  conditional in it. What changed is what the deck *says*:
  - the readout reports `—` and "Exploration stage", never `0 t @ 0 g/t`,
    which would be a measurement claim rather than an absence of one;
  - cut-off, colour-by, class chips, vein select, surfaces, plan, section and
    the deposit switcher are hidden, not disabled — dead inputs invite a
    presenter to keep pressing them;
  - the audit trail lists the datasets that DO exist and states plainly that
    no resource has been established.
  A camera still needs an extent: taken from `deck.settings.extent` or any
  asset carrying `stats.bounds`, and refused with a clear message if neither
  exists, because an exploration deck pointed at the wrong hemisphere is worse
  than one that admits it cannot place itself.
  Verified against a fixture deck with drills + geophysics and no block model.
  **Console half now done too.** Nothing is required: the slot order is
  exploration-first (property, geophysics, drills, then block model tagged
  "resource stage"), deck creation gates on a zone having ANY data rather than
  a resource, and a zone with data but no model reads "Exploration stage — N
  datasets · no resource estimate" instead of "No block model yet".
  Three Elk-specific lines were leaking into every hydrated deck and are now
  scoped: the class-mapping caveat (printed for projects with no classes), its
  orphaned second line, and "Silver is absent from the source".
- [x] 🟡 **#2 — First-class magnetic / geophysics data.** Mostly done.
  A grid is an image plus the six numbers that place it. World files (.tfw /
  .pgw / .jgw / .wld) are read, the half-pixel offset to the raster EDGE is
  handled, rotated grids are refused with a reason, product type is inferred
  from the filename (TMI / RTP / 1VD / 2VD / analytic signal / radiometrics /
  gravity), and each product drapes on its OWN extent rather than the set's
  union — two grids of one property are rarely clipped identically and
  stretching one to the other's corners moves the anomaly.
  The Explore control is built from the products the deck actually holds.
  **GeoTIFF is deliberately not decoded**: it needs a real TIFF reader for the
  tag soup, tiling and compression variants, and one written against a guess
  mis-georeferences *silently* — the survey lands in the wrong place and looks
  fine. PNG/JPEG plus a world file covers the same ground honestly.
  **Still open:** GeoTIFF, Geosoft .grd, gridding raw XYZ, and a colour ramp
  keyed to real nT values rather than percentile-clipped image colours.

## P1 — makes multi-zone and exploration real

- [x] 🟢 **#3 — Render multiple zones in the viewer.**
  <https://github.com/shayne-wq/orebody/issues/3>
  The `deck` function now reads the `zones` table, honours
  `decks.settings.zones` for subset + order, and stamps `zone_id` on every
  asset. The viewer groups assets by zone, and every zone carrying a block
  model becomes an entry in the deposit switcher — loaded on demand through
  the same OREB path the fabricated second deposit uses.
  This closed a silent correctness bug, not just a gap: datasets were selected
  by project alone and returned flat, so a two-zone project handed the viewer
  two block models with nothing to say which was which. It took the first —
  rendering one zone's geometry under a deck spanning both, and reporting that
  zone's tonnage as the deck's, with no symptom.
  Verified on a two-zone fixture: both zones listed and named, first active,
  switching loads the second. Deployed to the hosted project.
- [ ] 🔴 **#4 — Exploration-first deck template.** Property, geology, magnetics,
  geochem, drill highlights, targets, the ask — seeded from available data.
  <https://github.com/shayne-wq/orebody/issues/4>
- [ ] 🔴 **#5 — Geochemistry dataset kind** (soil / rock / stream sediment).
  <https://github.com/shayne-wq/orebody/issues/5>

## P1 — authoring: generate, curate, transition

The shape Shayne asked for (2026-08-08): once the data is uploaded, the
platform proposes **every slide the data can justify**; the user drags the ones
they want into a running order; the platform works out how to move between
them. Authoring becomes curation rather than construction.

- [x] 🟢 **#9 — Generate slide candidates from the data.** Walk what each zone
  has and emit every defensible view, each with camera, layers, title and a
  one-line body: property overview · claim block · each magnetics product ·
  each zone at 2–3 cut-offs · classification reveal · N–S and E–W sections ·
  drill forest · each headline intercept · property columns · asset-only.
  Twenty is realistic for a full project; an exploration zone with claims and
  magnetics yields eight. **Nothing is proposed that the data does not support**
  — no resource slides without a block model, no intercept slides without
  assays. Candidates are proposals, not chapters: they live unsaved until
  chosen.
- [x] 🟢 **#10 — Deck builder: drag candidates into a running order.** Two
  columns, pool and order. Drag in, reorder, drop out. Writes `chapters` with
  `ord`. **Shipped** on the deck page: pool and running order side by side,
  HTML5 drag-and-drop with positional insert, Add/Remove, and Save order which
  replaces `chapters` wholesale (the running order IS the deck — diffing would
  only risk orphans). Re-opening seeds the order from saved chapters.
  **Not done:** a thumbnail per candidate. `tools/capture_thumbs.py` already
  generates them from a built page, so this is wiring rather than invention,
  and the builder is noticeably harder to skim without it.
- [x] 🟢 **#11 — Computed transitions between consecutive slides.**
  This is geometry, not intelligence, and should be built as rules that can be
  reasoned about:
  - **shortest-arc heading** — interpolating 350° → 10° the long way is the
    whip-pan that makes a deck feel amateur;
  - **arc over terrain** — two points either side of the ridge must not be
    joined by a straight line through it; lift proportional to separation;
  - **duration from distance**, not a constant — a 5 km move and a 200 m
    nudge cannot share a 2.3 s flight;
  - **scale-jump guard** — beyond roughly an order of magnitude, pull back
    through an establishing frame rather than dollying the whole way;
  - **arm the next slide's layers before arrival**, so the destination does
    not pop into existence on landing.
  **Shipped** in `frameFor()`: shortest-arc heading normalisation, duration
  scaled from the distance actually being covered (1.1–4.2 s), an arc height
  proportional to separation so a traverse lifts over the ridge instead of
  through it, and a scale-jump guard that routes anything beyond 8× via an
  establishing frame. Layers were already armed before the camera moves — go()
  calls apply() first — so the destination is drawn before arrival.
  Measured across three chapter changes: worst per-step heading delta 19°/40°/18°,
  no runaway spin. **Not done:** storing the resolved path on the chapter so an
  export and a live present provably take the same route.

- [x] 🟢 **#12 — Claims by registry lookup, including the neighbours.**
  **Decision: look them up, do not ask the issuer to upload them.** Three
  reasons, in order of weight:
  1. **Neighbours cannot be uploaded.** A company does not hold its
     neighbours' tenure data and has no standing to assert it. Only the public
     register can say who owns the ground along strike — and that is often the
     most interesting fact on the map.
  2. **Claims are the most checkable thing in a mining deck.** A reader can
     put a tenure number into Mineral Titles Online and have an answer in a
     minute, so real tenure is a credibility asset and a fabricated boundary
     is the fabrication most likely to be caught.
  3. It already caught a real error — the owner records are how we learned the
     deck had the project in the wrong district.
  Shipped for BC: `tools/fetch_bc_claims.py` now takes two windows — the
  subject property (1.5 km) and the neighbourhood (6 km) — identifies the
  issuer as whoever holds the ground the deposit sits on, and stamps every
  tenure `_subject` / `_neighbour`. The viewer draws the issuer's ground gold
  and heavy, everyone else's thin and grey, with one label per neighbouring
  **holder** (not per tenure). Elk Gold: 54 tenures, 12 on the property, 42
  surrounding, held by Vizsla Copper, Barranco Gold, Flow Metals and five
  individuals.

  **Still to do, and each is a real constraint rather than polish:**
  - **Jurisdiction coverage.** BC, Ontario, Québec, WA, NSW and Queensland
    publish good open cadastres. US BLM is poor — claims are described by
    section rather than surveyed geometry. Much of Latin America and Africa is
    patchy or paywalled. So: look up where a register exists, **allow upload as
    a fallback, never require it.**
  - **Never render looked-up and uploaded claims identically.** Same
    discipline as real-versus-fabricated: registry tenure carries its number
    and the licence attribution; supplied tenure is styled apart and captioned
    "as supplied by the issuer".
  - **Currency.** Tenures lapse. The bake date must travel with the data and
    be shown — a lapsed claim drawn as current is a misstatement in an
    investor deck, not a stale cache.
  - **Logos: own only.** Dragging your own logo onto your own ground is fine.
    Putting a neighbour's logo on their claims is someone else's trademark
    implying a relationship that does not exist. The registered holder's
    **name** is a fact from a public register; a logo is branding. Names by
    default.

- [x] 🟡 **#13 — Ingest beyond a CSV export.** Substantially done; OMF outstanding. Today the answer to "can you
  take data from the popular mining packages" is: only via CSV, and only the
  block model is actually parsed.
  - **Formats — SHIPPED** in `dashboard/lib/formats.js`, 43 assertions in
    `tools/verify_formats.mjs`:
    | Data | Formats read |
    |---|---|
    | Block model | CSV / TSV, columns detected and correctable |
    | Drill holes | collars + surveys + assays CSV / TSV → **desurveyed by minimum curvature** |
    | Surfaces | **OBJ**, **GOCAD TSurf `.ts`**, **DXF** (3DFACE) |
    | Claims | **GeoJSON**, **KML** |
    Column names are matched loosely, so `HOLEID`/`BHID`/`DHID`, `RL`/`ELEV`/`Z`
    and `AT`/`DEPTH`/`MD` all resolve. Tab-separated exports work.
    Every non-block upload is now **parsed before it is stored** — a file that
    cannot be read is refused by name with what to export instead, rather than
    landing as a green slot containing a blob nothing can draw.
    Unreadable formats are *named*: `.omf`, `.dm`, `.bmf`, `.mdl`, `.dwbm`,
    `.dat`, `.lfview`, a lone `.shp`. Each says what to export instead.
    **Still open: OMF.** It remains the right long-term answer — one reader for
    most of the market — and is deliberately not attempted from a guess at the
    binary layout, because a parser written blind mis-reads silently.
  - **Sub-blocked models.** Tonnage is `dx·dy·dz × density × ore fraction`, one
    volume for every block. A sub-blocked model breaks that. Now REFUSED when
    the file carries per-block dimension columns (XINC/YINC/ZINC and friends).
    **Honest limit:** coordinates alone cannot detect it — a 2.5 m sub-block in
    a 10 m parent is indistinguishable from a 2.5 m grid with holes, verified
    on a synthetic case. A sub-blocked export with no dimension columns still
    gets through, and would report a confident wrong tonnage.
  - **Rotated models.** Not representable at all; no bearing/dip/plunge.
  - **Projections — SHIPPED.** `useProjection()` generates proj4 definitions
    rather than listing them: WGS84 UTM (both hemispheres), NAD83, NAD27, GDA94
    and GDA2020 MGA — around 180 zones — plus BC Albers, NZTM, OSGB, RGF93 and
    Web Mercator. A project's EPSG drives every reprojection in the viewer; an
    unknown code fails with a sentence naming it rather than rendering the
    deposit in the wrong hemisphere.
  - **One grade column.** No multi-element, no by-element cut-offs.
  - **Only blocks are parsed.** Drills, surfaces, geophysics and claims are
    stored as opaque blobs (#2, #6, #7).

## Data the deck can consume (per zone)

| Dataset | Required (resource) | Required (exploration) | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Block model | ✅ | ❌ (see #1) | native CSV, read in-browser | drives tonnage/grade/economics |
| Magnetics / geophysics | optional | often the primary evidence (#2) | grid/raster + CRS | TMI/RTP/1VD, legend |
| Drill holes | optional | common | collars/surveys/assays CSV (#6) | desurvey → traces + intercepts |
| Geochemistry | — | common (#5) | sample CSV | soil/rock/stream anomalies |
| Surfaces | optional | rare | OBJ/DXF/JSON (#7) | vein / grade shells |
| Property & claims | optional | recommended | GeoJSON | claim extent, colour-pop |

## Log

- **2026-08-08** — Uploaded data now renders: drills (desurveyed, with beads,
  grade bars and headline intercepts), surfaces (OBJ/GOCAD/DXF, labelled in
  scene) and claims. Geophysics grids parse and drape from a world file (#2).
  Named targets from `deck.settings.targets`. Assay threshold control. And
  intercepts are labelled **downhole** rather than implying true width.
  Two honesty bugs found and fixed on the way: the geophysics legend said
  FABRICATED unconditionally, so a customer's own airborne survey was captioned
  fabricated; and the product buttons were the demo's, so a hydrated deck
  offered TMI when it held only RTP and 1VD.

- **2026-08-08** — #13 largely done. Projections unblocked (~180 UTM zones +
  named grids, generated not listed). Readers for OBJ / GOCAD / DXF / GeoJSON /
  KML and full collar-survey-assay desurvey by minimum curvature. Aux uploads
  now parse before storing, so an unreadable file is refused by name instead of
  becoming a green slot with nothing behind it. 43 format assertions; the
  desurvey ones check against independently computed trigonometry, which is how
  an inverted dip sign that drilled every hole upwards got caught.
  **Open: OMF, geophysics grids (#2), sub-blocked models without dimension
  columns.**

- **2026-08-08** — Ingest audit (#13). Found that a sub-blocked model would
  have been read at one block volume and reported a confident wrong tonnage,
  silently. Now refused when the file declares per-block dimensions. Verified
  the real Elk Gold export still passes 36/36, so the guard does not
  false-positive on a regular grid.

- **2026-08-08** — Upload is drag-and-drop properly now: drop a folder of
  exports onto a zone and they are classified by filename and routed into
  slots, uploaded without a modal. Block models still open the mapping step
  (their columns must be confirmed before tonnage is computed) and anything
  unrecognised is reported rather than guessed. **Never inferred: whether data
  is fabricated** — that is a claim about provenance, not a property of the
  bytes, so a routed upload records real and the user says otherwise.

- **2026-08-08** — Upload UX: slots are now drop targets. Previously only the
  block-model modal accepted a dropped file; the aux modals (property,
  geophysics, drills, surfaces) had bare file inputs, and the slot boxes
  themselves ignored drops entirely — so the first gesture anyone tries did
  nothing. Dropping on a slot now opens the right modal with the file already
  answered, and every field inside accepts a drop too.

- **2026-08-08** — #9/#10/#11 shipped: candidate generation (shared module),
  the drag-and-drop builder, and computed transitions. Found and fixed a
  latent crash on the deck page — renderChapters() dereferenced a #chlist the
  builder had replaced, and route()'s catch turned a dead page into a toast.
  **Still open: #2 magnetics as first-class data, #4 exploration deck
  template, #5 geochem, #6 drill parsing, #7 surface meshes, #8 deck editor
  zone controls.** Untouched, not started.

- **2026-08-08** — #12 claims-by-lookup shipped for BC, with neighbouring
  holders named. Decision recorded: registry lookup over issuer upload,
  because neighbours cannot be self-asserted.

- **2026-08-08** — #1 console half done: nothing is a required dataset, slots
  reordered exploration-first, deck creation gated on data rather than on a
  resource. #9/#10/#11 opened for generate → curate → transition.

- **2026-08-08** — #3 shipped. `deck` fn is zone-aware and deployed; viewer
  builds the deposit switcher from zones. Fixed the flat-asset-list bug that
  would have mis-rendered any multi-zone deck. **The upload → zones → 3D chain
  is now connected end to end**, with two caveats: the console still asks for a
  block model (#1 console half) and no real multi-zone project has been put
  through it — only fixtures.

- **2026-08-08** — #1 viewer half shipped (exploration mode). Tracking branch
  merged to `main`. Elk-specific audit caveats scoped so hydrated decks stop
  inheriting claims about a source file they have never seen.
- **2026-08-08** — Mobile: iOS Safari refused this page a WebGL context while
  granting one to a bare canvas. Chain of causes, all ours: the boot catch
  discarded the stack; the WebGL probe leaked the context it was testing for;
  the drawing buffer was full 3x; the document was 5.8 MB, of which 4.5 MB was
  a base64 block model. Model now travels as fetched OREB v1 and the page is
  1.1 MB. The service worker was also cache-first on the document, so every
  fix took two reloads to reach a returning visitor — now network-first.
  **Unresolved:** whether the iPhone renders 3D. Not reproducible here.
- **2026-08-08** — Deck payload: bucket rollups were named but never signed, so
  a hydrated deck could not total anything; and provenance leaked
  `<org_id>/…` storage paths, re-exposing the tenant UUID the payload
  deliberately omits. Both fixed; four assertions added. **Not yet run** —
  OrbStack has a pending update and will not start its daemon.
